# Robotics-arm

*  Calculate the alogrithm of kinematics, and inverse-kinematics for a 6-DOF robotics arm.
*  Design the alogrithm of motion planning by joint variables or NOAP.
*  The GUI is designed by original Matlab GUIDE.
*  Additional 3d Plot is thanks to the work of "Matlab Robotics ToolBox".
